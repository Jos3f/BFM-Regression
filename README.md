# BFM-Regression

According to the World Health Organization, obesity is a major risk factor for several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. In order to operationalize obesity, one can use the body fat mass (BFM). The problem with this is that the highly accurate methods of doing this is expensive. Some simpler measurements are known to be related to the BFM, such as waist circumference and waist-to-hip-ratio. We have access to a dataset with BMF measurements (or more precisely, body density measurements) on males and corresponding measurements such as height, weight and age. Our main goal is to develop and validate our own regression model for prediction of the BFM. This includes through residual analysis, handling outliers, analyzing occurrences of multicolinearity and variable selection methods using different performance criteria. 

## Code
The code of our analysis can be found in [project1.R](https://github.com/Jos3f/BFM-Regression/blob/master/project1.R). The help functions and data sets used are located in the same directory.
